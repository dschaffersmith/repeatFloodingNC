A NatureNet project was initiated in 2018 in by The Center for Biodiversity Outcomes and The Nature Conservancy to identify solutions for water quality management under extremes ranging from floods to droughts with a focus on agroecosystems. Hurricanes that damage lives and property are accompanied by poor water quality that affects both human and natural communities, yet these water quality impacts are difficult to quantify. To aid in understanding the implications of elevated storm frequency and intensity, we developed an operational remote sensing-based hurricane flood extent mapping method, analyzed potential impacts to human and natural assets from Hurricane Matthew (2016) and Hurricane Florence (2018) in North Carolina, and identified options that could reduce impacts and increase resilience to future storms. Flooding detected with synthetic aperture radar (>91% accuracy) extended beyond state-mapped hazard zones.
